# Responsive_Portfolio
A recreated portfolio page using Bootstrap

This is an updated version of my portfolio website from our first homework assignment, this time using Bootstrap's grid system to make the page responsive to different screen sizes and elements for quick and easy additions to the page's layout, such as navbars and form-groups. It involves an About Me page, a Portfolio page, and a contact page.  

The page is done with as much styling and layout in Bootstrap as I could manage, with minimal css styling for personal touches.
