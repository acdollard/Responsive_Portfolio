# Responsive_Portfolio
A recreated portfolio page using Bootstrap
This is an updated version of my portfolio website from our first homework assignment, this time using Bootstrap's grid system to make the page responsive to different screen sizes and elements for quick and easy additions to the page's layout, such as navbars and form-groups.
