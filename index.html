                My name is Alex Dollard, I'm good at music and... so-so at sports, I can talk about books for longer 
                than most people would care to but football games for less than a full sentence, and I'm very
                self-conscious about my singing voice although I really want to sing. I'm absent-minded and daydream often.
                I'm unsure of most things but I'm pretty sure I'm a kind person, or at least I try to be. I believe there's also 
                an important difference between being kind and being nice. I also believe that relationships
                are the most valuable things in life. I believe in always trying your best, even if I don't always follow through
                with that belief. I'm spiritual, but not religious. I've noticed that when I'm in an argument with someone and 
                I start to get mad it usually means the other person is right.

                The thing that excites me most about coding is that you get to solve a logic puzzle, and at the end, you get an 
                actual, working thing. A thing that you made and brought into the world. It'd be like if every time 
                you solved a riddle you got a new piece of furniture. I can think of few things that would be so rewarding.
                Raising a kid? Maybe. I wouldn't know. I hope to find out one day. <br>
                <br>
                Anyway, I'm here to learn a new and useful trade, to really push myself at something difficult, and hopefully
                come out on the other side with a little more sense of direction, if not armed with a newfound set of skills that I can 
                take with me in my aimlessness. Thanks for listening. 
                I hope to get a beer or coffee with you and get to know you better someday soon.
